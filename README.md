# Introduction
This project will be implementing a game mechanic in virtual reality, creating something inovative.

## Initial Research
Going into this research I have an initial idea I am interested in looking into. Making a marionette in the virtual world that will be controlled by a player.

### Marionette
I started by looking to see if anyone had used marionettes in vr games yet. I wasn't able to find any in a game, but i did stumble apon a blog.

Bringing this idea over into unity could be interesting, in the blog he uses a plugin for unreal to create the ropes between the puppet and the controller. There is an asset avaliable on the unity store to simulate rope, but for the price I don't believe it would be worth it for my needs. 
As an alternate I have found some video tutortials that guide you through creating a basic rope in unity.

Another section of this blog shows the positioning of the static character, this reminds me of the classic artist wooden human models used for referencing the body in specific positions.
This could be something that is implemented into vr art creation tools to provide reference for the artist.
Another idea for this was given to me by Al was to make this into a game where the player has to pose the body of the marionette to match poses given by the game.

### New Controller
Valve are working on a new controller that gives the ability to track grip input from each finger on the hand, along with being strapped to the hand so you are able to let go with every finger.

Having this ability could would work really well with posing a model. But this not being widely available yet restricts the idea of implementing it and restricting the games market.

### Concluding thoughts
I have spent a bit of time thinking over how the marionette or the poseable model could be built into interesting games.
For the marionette I believe a fun way to use this mechanic would be to create a game that requires you to control the marionette puppet through the average day of a human, the fun would come from the awkwardness of controlling a marionette through normally easy to do tasks. There are a few glaring issues that would need to be considered. The first being that a marionette can useually be picked up and moved across any distance without being made to walk, this would either need to be considered in the game layout, or have a restriction on how the player uses the puppet. However restricting how the player can control the puppet could take away a good amount of fun. The second issue is that with the puppet control likely being difficult to beginners having tasks that are too complex could be overly frustating, this might limit the ability to simulate everyday tasks in the game.

For the poseable model I have taken a real liking to the idea of having to pose the model into specific poses that will allow it to get through a gap in an approaching wall. The fun in this game comes from posing the model into poses, some being whimsical that a normal human probably couldn't do. The scale of this idea is smaller than the marrionette game allowing for greater polishing. I've been pointed towards an old game show called "hole in the wall" which does exactly what I was considering but using the players body in real life instead of a model in virtual reality. Issues that I have considered with this idea is that the accuracy in which you are able to quickly pose the model will need to be very good. The fact that you have a time limit in which to pose the model could put some people off from the game, to combat this I could create an untimed mode where you purely have to pose the model into requested poses.

# Game Proposal
I have decided to create a game which is a slight homage to the gameshow "hole in the wall". The player will have a poseable human model, they will need to pose the model to match the hole shown in the oncoming wall.
