# Introduction
This project will be implementing a game mechanic in virtual reality, creating something inovative.

## Initial Research
Going into this research I have an initial idea I am interested in looking into. Making a marionette in the virtual world that will be controlled by a player.

### Marionette
I started by looking to see if anyone had used marionettes in vr games yet. I wasn't able to find any in a game, but i did stumble apon a blog.

Bringing this idea over into unity could be interesting, in the blog he uses a plugin for unreal to create the ropes between the puppet and the controller. There is an asset avaliable on the unity store to simulate rope, but for the price I don't believe it would be worth it for my needs. 
As an alternate I have found some video tutortials that guide you through creating a basic rope in unity.

Another section of this blog shows the positioning of the static character, this reminds me of the classic artist wooden human models used for referencing the body in specific positions.
This could be something that is implemented into vr art creation tools to provide reference for the artist.
Another idea for this was given to me by Al was to make this into a game where the player has to pose the body of the marionette to match poses given by the game.

### New Controller
Valve are working on a new controller that gives the ability to track grip input from each finger on the hand, along with being strapped to the hand so you are able to let go with every finger.

Having this ability could would work really well with posing a model. But this not being widely available yet restricts the idea of implementing it and restricting the games market.

# Game Proposal
Having looked at initial ideas and considering how they could be incorperated into a game I have decided to create a game which is a slight homage to the gameshow "hole in the wall". The player will have a poseable human model, they will need to pose the model to match the hole shown in the oncoming wall.
